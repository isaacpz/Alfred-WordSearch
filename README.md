# Word Search
Word Search is an Alfred 2/3 workflow which exposes powerful word searching utilities. Ultimately, the workflow can be leveraged to widen your vocabulary and make you a better writer.

## Quick Reference
* `syn [word]` - Broadly searches for words related to a word/phrase.
* `dsyn [word]` - Searches for a word’s exact synonyms.
* `ant [word]` - Searches for a word’s antonyms.
* `rhyme [word]` - Searches a word’s rhymes.
* `describing [word]` - Searches for words that describe another word
## Usage
